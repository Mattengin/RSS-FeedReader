Thanks to the Udacity forums on this project! Helped explain things a bit more!

# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.
 
 ## What is a feed reader or RSS reader?
 
by Paul Gil

Staying up to date with everything on the internet that interests you is challenging. Instead of visiting many of the same websites every day, you can instead take advantage of RSS—short for Really Simple Syndication—to gather headlines from those sites and either feed them directly to your computer or app automatically or place them at a website you view online. If you want additional information about the story behind the headline, you can always click on the headline to read more.
